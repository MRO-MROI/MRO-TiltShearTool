 * The purpose of this class is to implement a server that can accept
 * commands for executing the Tilt/Shear alignment procedure without 
 * relying on GUI controls.
 * 
 * The command server uses commands to emulate GUI buttons/fields for
 * setting up alignment and executing the correction.
 * 
 * The only feedback available for the tilt and shear images obtained from the camera
 * is text based (i.e. printed to stdout or to a data file).  No GUI components are painted 
 * to the screen and image updates will happen only in memory.
