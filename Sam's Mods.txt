Note:  Certain changes (including deleting certain scripts) are not included.  For more detail look at dirty package.  

Wrote CameraPanel to allow user to switch between camera configuration files easily.  

Wrote PIRules to handle error checking in the algorithm to be implemented if limit switches are added to the mounts (implemented with PIControl lines 476 to 480).

Added homing buttons to actuator to be implemented if limit switches are added (ActuatorPanel lines 141 and 151)

Added ability to set home position to current position (AlignPanel line 97)





Personal Notes (no need to read if not Sam): 

Removed lines near PIControl line 168 to turn off hack that caused wierdness with crosshairs. It May be worth reusing for trouble shooting)
	//Reference Hack  
		tref.x = 290;
		tref.y = 226;
		sref.x = 290;
		sref.y = 226;
	//End Hack

Changed method in PIControl line 379 to computeThetaCorrection, commenting out most of the other methods in AllignmentMath
Simplified AlignmentMath.computeStepCorrection  
Commented out PIControl 408 to 409 so calculations use old method that  only (works better with movement)
